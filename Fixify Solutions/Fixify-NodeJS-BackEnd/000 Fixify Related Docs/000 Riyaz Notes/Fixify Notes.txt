MongoDB Atlas (small but production-suitable cluster): ~ US $56.94/month
AWS for hosting + some storage (backend + static files + images): US $5–20/month (or more if traffic/storage grows)
Notification service (OneSignal free tier): US $0–19/month
SMS/OTP via Twilio: depends heavily on number of messages — e.g. 1000 SMS → ~$8.30 (if $0.0083 each)
Payment gateway (Razorpay): no monthly cost; you pay per transaction (2–3% of transaction amount)
Email service: likely negligible for low volume (when using free tiers)
So in early stage, it is quite possible to have total external-services cost under US $80–100/month
In development stage we will try to use the free-tier of each service
